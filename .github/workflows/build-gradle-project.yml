  # This workflow uses actions that GitHub does not certify.
  # They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
  # separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
  # documentation.

  # GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA.
  # To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA.
  # You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.

  # Only create a release on main branch, should update to adwise-fiu eventually.
